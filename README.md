# Seinfeld-script-generation-using-RNN-
 ## Project overview:
 In this project I built a Reccurrent neural network (RNN) to generate new fake TV scripts . <br>
 The model was trained on [Seinfeld dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/thec03u5/seinfeld-chronicles#scripts.csv) <br>
 *Example of the results* : <br>
 
```
elaine: beep, tear out to the table and the stand.

kramer: well, i am a cheater.

elaine: what?

newman: well it's a good one of the incident.

elaine: oh. i don't know, i was wondering that you want to do it anymore.

```
 ## Getting started : 
 In order to reproduce this work you need first to : 
 ### 1. Clone this repository 
 
``
git clone https://github.com/ZSoumia/-Seinfeld-script-generation-using-RNN-.git
``

### 2. Download the data : 
The data is available here [Seinfeld dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/thec03u5/seinfeld-chronicles#scripts.csv) 
If you wish to know more about these data refer to [Seinfeld](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Seinfeld)

### 3. Make sure you have all the necessay libraries :
In this project I used the following tools : 
- Python 3.6 
- Pytorch 
### 4. Some tips : 
The RNN models are somehow expensive in training(require a good processing and memory) so to accelerate the training process it's advised to train on a GPU( Google Colab , AWS , or Kaggle )
